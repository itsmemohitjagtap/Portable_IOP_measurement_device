Portable Air Puff Tonometer - Home-Based IOP and CCT Measurement

   Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a   Portable Air Puff Tonometer   that enables users to monitor   Intraocular Pressure (IOP)   and   Central Corneal Thickness (CCT)   from the comfort of their homes. Built with an   ESP32 microcontroller  ,   IR sensors  , and an   air-puff mechanism  , the device offers a cost-effective and user-friendly alternative to traditional tonometry devices.

   Key Features
-   Non-Contact Measurement  : The device uses an air-puff mechanism and infrared sensors to measure IOP and CCT without any direct contact with the eye.
-   Portable and Affordable  : Compact design for easy home use, with low production costs to make it accessible.
-   High Accuracy  : Incorporates   CCT corrections   to improve IOP measurement accuracy.
-   Bluetooth Integration  : Seamless connection with the   Clear Sight   mobile app for real-time data monitoring.
-   Rechargeable Battery  : Powered by a   Li-ion battery   for prolonged use without the need for frequent recharging.
-   Auto Nozzle Cleaning  : Ensures consistent performance by automatically cleaning the air nozzle before each use.

   App and Device Display UI
The project includes a   user-friendly mobile app   that connects to the device via Bluetooth, allowing users to view their IOP and CCT readings on their smartphones. The   device display UI   shows real-time measurement data, including IOP, CCT, and system status.

    App UI Features:
-   Real-Time Monitoring  : Displays IOP and CCT values instantly.
-   Data Storage  : Saves past readings for tracking trends.
-   Simple, Clean Interface  : Designed for ease of use, especially for elderly patients.

    Device Display UI:
-   Interactive Display  : Shows IOP and CCT readings directly on the device.
-   Bluetooth Pairing Status  : Indicates connectivity with the mobile app.
-   Battery Status  : Displays the remaining battery life for uninterrupted use.

   Technologies Used
-   ESP32 Microcontroller  : Controls the device and processes sensor data.
-   IR Emitter and Receiver  : Measures corneal reflections to calculate CCT.
-   Air Pump and Pressure Valve  : Generates the air puff used to flatten the cornea.
-   Bluetooth  : Enables communication between the device and the mobile app.
-   3D Modeling  : Used to design the compact and portable casing for the device.

   How It Works
1.   Power On  : The device initializes and connects to the app via Bluetooth.
2.   CCT Measurement  : The IR emitter sends a beam of light to the cornea, and the sensor measures the reflection to calculate corneal thickness.
3.   IOP Measurement  : An air puff is applied to the cornea, and the device calculates the pressure needed to flatten the cornea.
4.   Data Display  : The calculated IOP and CCT values are displayed on the device screen and transmitted to the app in real-time.

   How to Set Up
1.   Download the Clear Sight App  : Available on Android/iOS.
2.   Pair the Device  : Use Bluetooth to connect the tonometer to the app.
3.   Measure IOP/CCT  : Follow the instructions on the device display to take measurements.
4.   View Results  : Check your IOP and CCT readings directly on the device or through the app.

   Future Improvements
-   AI/ML Integration  : To enable predictive analysis and personalized health recommendations based on user data.
-   Cloud Data Storage  : Option to store readings in the cloud for easy access by healthcare providers.
